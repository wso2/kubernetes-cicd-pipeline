# Helm Resources for WSO2 Kubernetes Pipeline
*Helm Resources for container-based deployments of WSO2 Kubernetes Pipeline for WSO2 products*

## Overview
The tools consist of Jenkins and Spinnaker. They are the primary tools used for continuous integration and deployment. The setup is deployed on top of Kubernetes using HELM, which makes the processes of configuration, installation, scaling, and upgrading simple. Additionally, Jenkins jobs and Spinnaker pipelines are preconfigured, making the process of getting started hassle-free.
